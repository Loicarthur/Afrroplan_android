## Security (RLS)

The database uses Row Level Security extensively:
- **Admins**: Full access to everything via `is_admin()` helper.
- **Owners**: Access to their own salon data (services, bookings, etc.).
- **Clients**: Access to their own bookings, profiles, and public salon info.

Helper functions:
- `is_admin()`: Returns true if `auth.uid()` is an admin.
- `is_coiffeur()`: Returns true if `auth.uid()` is a coiffeur.
- `is_client()`: Returns true if `auth.uid()` is a client.

## Special Features

- **Haversine Distance**: `calculate_distance_km()` for finding nearby home-service coiffeurs.
- **Automatic Ratings**: `update_salon_rating()` trigger updates salon average rating on new reviews.
- **Promotion Validation**: `is_promotion_valid()` checks usage limits, dates, and service compatibility.
